IMPORTANT!
===========

The Icon Picker does NOT include the actual icon fonts!  Why?  You may already have them, depending on your WordPress set-up, or you can go get the latest versions of the fonts from their respective project pages:

Dashicons- comes with WordPress 3.8+ and is used for the new Admin UI.  Or get it here:
https://github.com/melchoyce/dashicons

Genericons - came with the WordPress default theme "Twenty Thirteen" or get it by itself here:
http://genericons.com/#menu

Font Awesome - a popular icon font with WordPress theme designers.  You can download it here:
http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/

Once you have the fonts put them in the ~wp-content/plugins/icon-picker/fonts/ folder
then enqueue them properly for both the Admin area and for the front-end of your site (see the sample plugin php code for how to do that).
